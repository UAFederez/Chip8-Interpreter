# CHIP-8 Interpreter

A small interpreter for the CHIP-8 programming language implemented using C and the SDL2 library. This application features a live display of the running program instructions as well as the registers. The demo ROM for the Sierpinski triagle is sourced from [Kripod](https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms).
